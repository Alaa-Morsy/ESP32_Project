# ESP32_Project
Control a Relay Module and a 7-Segment Display using ESP32 with Micropython

the project concept :
Using a relay Module to control AC household loads remotely. The relay itself will be controlled by an ESP32 Chip which will be controlled using a micropython code.
The relay will control a lightbulb. We also use the esp-32 to control a seven-segment display.
All by using a web server html will enable us to control this entire circuit remotely.
Using a smart phone or a laptop with the application on it. We will be able to turn the light on and off. 
The seven-segment display will be decremented and incremented.
